//TODO üìï Module 06 - Loops, Iteration and High Order Array Methods - Lesson 06: `for...in` Loop


//TODO üìù Step 1: Theoretical Exploration

//* 1. üìò What Is the `for...in` Loop?
//  The `for...in` loop is a control structure in JavaScript used to iterate over the enumerable properties (keys) of an object.

//  Syntax:

for (let key in object) {
    // code block to be executed
}

//* 2. üß† How It Works
//  ‚Ä¢ It loops over keys (property names) in an object.
//  ‚Ä¢ At each iteration, key is assigned a string value that corresponds to a property name in the object.

//  ‚úçÔ∏è Example:

const user = {
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 28,
    occupation: 'Engineer'
};

for (let key in user) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${user[key]}`);
}

//  ‚úçÔ∏è Output:
//  ‚Ä¢ name: Alice
//  ‚Ä¢ age: 28
//  ‚Ä¢ occupation: Engineer

//* 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations
//  ‚Ä¢ `for...in` iterates over enumerable properties, including those inherited through the prototype chain.
//  ‚Ä¢ If you want to exclude inherited properties, use hasOwnProperty():

//* 4. ‚õî When NOT to Use It
//  ‚Ä¢ Do not use `for...in` with arrays if you care about order or index, or need performance.
//  ‚Ä¢ It does not guarantee the order of keys, and may include prototype chain properties.

const arr = [10, 20, 30];
for (let index in arr) {
    console.log(index);
}
//! Yes, it works ‚Äì but it's not best practice. Prefer for, forEach, or for...of for arrays.

//* 5. ‚úÖ When to Use It
//  ‚Ä¢ When iterating over object properties.
//  ‚Ä¢ When order doesn‚Äôt matter.
//  ‚Ä¢ When performing a deep inspection of object content.
